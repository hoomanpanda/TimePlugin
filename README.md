# BakkesMod Plugin to show IRL Time In-Game

Shows time in yellow in the "top middle" position for a 1920 to 1080 screen. 
(for me atleast)

Its really just for me but sharing cuz it looks like I'm the first.

You could request more stuff if you want. I wont make any promises to do/be able to do them tho. Took me like couple days of 2 hour sittings to follow a simple tutorial lol

Dont forget to enable in plugin manager

 ## Sidenote
is this plugin idea taboo or something? am i gonna face repurcissions for tis. idk. not having irl time shown in game does seem beneficial espescially if game is immersive and time is lost track of often. rl is prolly a good example. for me at least. hopefully psyonix wont kill me for this. i may or may not be responsible for losing millions if not billions for them lol. whatever tho. this seem like the right thing to do so ill die on this hill i guess(not like i got responsibilities that may be unfulfilled if i were to actually die because of this {*he does*}).  if you are a full grown man child who cant manage his time properly (not me btw) then this one is for you.

## tldr 
anxiety attack
