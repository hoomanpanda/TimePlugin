# BakkesMod Plugin to show IRL Time In-Game

Its really just for me but sharing cuz it looks like I'm the first. 
I'm sure someone other than me has wanted this feature before. 

Dont forget to enable in plugin manager

 ## Sidenote
is this plugin idea taboo or something? am i gonna face repurcissions for this. idk. not having irl time shown in game does seem beneficial espescially if game is immersive and time is lost track of often. rl is prolly a good example. for me at least. hopefully psyonix wont kill me for this. i may or may not be responsible for losing millions if not billions for them lol. whatever tho. this seem like the right thing to do so ill die on this hill i guess(not like i got responsibilities that may be unfulfilled if i were to actually die because of this {he does}). if you are one to get carried away with time (not me btw) then this one is for you.

## tldr 
anxiety attack
